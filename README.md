It is means that the light before the dawn or the brillant and colorful plasma phenommenon, which is caused by the solar charged-particle flow entering into the earth's magnetic field, and the brilliant and beautiful glow at night in the high altitude near the north and south poles of the earth. Whatever the light before the dawn or the glow at night, They are all charming!
